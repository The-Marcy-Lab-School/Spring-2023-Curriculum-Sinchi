## Objective

For this lab, you'll be recreating this simple [webpage](https://codepen.io/thuyanduong/full/jOMogvY). However, you are not allowed to manipulate the `index.html` or the `styles.css` files. You will need to re-create this entire webpage in your `index.js` file **using only JavaScript**. This assignment will allow you to practice DOM manipulation. You should manually create each DOM element you need, append them to the correct parent, and edit their attributes using the DOM API. You **should not use Element.innerHTML**. 

You should use [this Code Pen](https://codepen.io/thuyanduong/pen/jOMogvY) to see the HTML and CSS that you will be re-creating **using only JavaScript**.
