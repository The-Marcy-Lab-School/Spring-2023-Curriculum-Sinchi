# Lecture Prep Material

For your own records, please only make copies of this material, and don't change the actual repo unless something is broken. Assignments are built off the code here, so we don't want anything accidentally getting dropped.

## Lecture prep
This is all of the code and concepts that the lecture will cover. However, it may be broken up into several different files to convey time passing. For more information check the `skills.md` file. It will cover the broad strokes skills we're looking to teach in that lecture.

The idea is that you will roughly follow this structure as you live code in class. There will be tangents of course, but this is the main idea.

## Lecture
This is where your lecture should *start*. Make a copy of this folder and use it for the actual lecture with students. Whether you then upload the folder directly to GitHub or include it in some master lecture repo for your class is up to you. Saving the code as a cohort will be helpful in case you covered extra material, or used slightly different examples.

## Skills.md
This shows the overview of the skills to teach, and the expected skills the students will need for the lecture.
