## Lecture: Code-a-Long - Our Landing Page Mockup
* We will recreate [this "Mockup"](https://www.figma.com/proto/Vm0MzNYpiV6ihbQHOb1SCH/9.12.19-Code-a-long-1?scaling=min-zoom&node-id=1%3A3)
* On the job, a designer (or you!) might create a wireframe or a mockup of what your app or site should look like. It will then be your job to translate this into front end code.

### Our Process
1. Structure page with HTML. We will use:
  * `body`
    * `header`
        * `h1` and `h3`
    * `main`
        * `aside`
            * `ul`
            * `li` **be sure to target juice with an `id`**
        * `article`
            * `p`
            * `p`
            * `figure`
              * `figcaption`

2. Style the page
  * Set the background colore of the `body`
  * Set width of `main`
  * Set `section` and `article` to `display: inline-block`
  * Set `section` and `article` to `max-height: fill-available`
  * Set background colors
