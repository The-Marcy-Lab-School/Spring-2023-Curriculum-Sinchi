* How does `width`, `height`, `border`, `margin`, and `padding` affect _inline_ elements?
* How does `inline-block` styling differ from `block` and `inline` styling?

### Floats
* What does it mean to _float_ a block?
* How did developers use _floats_ in the past to layout a page and what has since replaced this method?
