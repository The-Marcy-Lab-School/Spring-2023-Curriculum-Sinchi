# Relationships! 

Hey gang, so `src` is what we did in class, it's not finished but shows a half complete many-to-many relationship. To see a more done example, check out book-src. That uses Book, BookGenre, Genre for it's relationship. 

Really focus on the _concepts_ here. Specifically the idea of has many/belongs to because that will allow you to understand pretty much all other relationships.
